# Room Mapper
This project was part of my A-Level Computer Science NEA Project in early 2022, where I created a product to take a 2D mapping of a room, using a Raspberry Pi, LiDAR sensor and some other components.
I used python to control the Raspberry Pi and also created a web interface using html and php which was used to control and add settings to the device.
